all squeezed out- out- out

i love bill joggings

you dont know what they're like, you fall for em, you really love em, you think this is gonna be the biggest thing since the graf zeppelin. Then one morning you wake up, the guy's gone, the saxophone's gone, all thats left behind is a pair of old socks and
a tube of toothpaste,
all squeezed out.
